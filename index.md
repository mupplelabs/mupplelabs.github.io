Hello World! Welcome to my little corner of the internet...
- Iâ€™m interested in cycling, bicycles, music, electronics, computer programming, data science,
  movies, reading, drawing, writing, printing and arts in general...
- I love taking objects from virtuality into reality using CNC Machines, 3D Printers and Lasers... and an assorted collection of handtools
- My week days I spend working in the computer storage industry architecting mass data storage solutions that scale 100s of PBs
- This is the space where I am collecting my random musings of various subject.
